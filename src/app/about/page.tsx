						<p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-lg">
							GVAS was established in June 2024 as a Name, Image,
							and Likeness (NIL) cooperative to provide financial
							support to Grand Valley football student-athletes,
							adhering to NCAA standards and state laws. In our
							inaugural year, we supported 19 football players
							with $28,000 in food gift cards, thanks to the
							generosity of 17 donors who contributed over
							$57,000.
						</p>
						<p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">
							Operating as an LLC, GVAS remains a separate entity
							from GVSU and the GV Football Alumni Association,
							ensuring compliance with NCAA regulations while
							maximizing support for our athletes.
